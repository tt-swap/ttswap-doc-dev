### ‚ùì 7. Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: üìâ What if the token price never rises?**

**Q: üîì What can unlocked tokens be used for?**  
A: They can be freely traded, used for voting, staked, or invested.

**Q: üïµÔ∏è Can this mechanism be manipulated?**  
A: No, all allocation and unlock records are publicly available on-chain and transparent.

**Q: ü§î Why do unlock ratios increase from (Founder > Partners > Value Contributors > Capital Contributors)?**
A: The design principle is to bind core project members more closely to long-term project value. As the project grows, more core roles receive greater benefits.

**Q: ‚è∞ Why not use the common time-based unlocking?**  
A: Time-based unlocking allows teams to unlock and sell even without achieving results, harming ordinary token holders' interests and being unfair to regular holders.
